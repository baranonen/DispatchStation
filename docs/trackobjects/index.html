    <h2>Track Objects</h2>
    <p>Every signals, point machines etc. which are connected to the signalling system are called track objects.</p>
    <h3>Signals</h3>
    <p>Signals are the main communication way between the train drivers and the signalling system. They have two aspects; red and green. Because of this, the speed limits are transmitted to the train using the EBICAB 700 ATC system.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples of how signals can be displayed in the EBICOS system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Blank</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/blank.jpg" alt="">
            <p>There is no route set and the aspect is red.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Red</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/red.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Signal is at the end of a route and the aspect is red.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Blocked</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/redblocked.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The signal is closed and blocked with the BSK command. The aspect is red.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Green</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/green.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A route from this signal is set and the train can continue. The aspect is green.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cancelled</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/cancelled.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A route from this signal was set but then it was cancelled. The signal will stay closed for a minute for safety. The aspect is red.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>End of Track / Signalling</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/endsignal.jpg" alt="">
            <p>End of track / signalling signals have a different shape, but the usage is the same. They always show the red aspect.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The queued routes are also shown with small triangles.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Route Start</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/greenstart.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A route starting from this signal is queued.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Route End</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/greenend.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A route ending at this signal is queued.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Switches</h3>
    <p>Switches can be moved to diverging/normal positions using the attached point machines. They can be displayed like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Normal</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/pointnormal.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The switch is in normal position.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Diverging</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/pointdiverging.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The switch is in diverging position.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>No Position</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/pointnoposition.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The switch is not set to any position. This is mostly shown when the switch is being set.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Local Control</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/pointlocal.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The switch is in local control mode. It can't be controlled from the EBICOS system and its position can't be seen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Flank Protection</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/flankprotection.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The switch is in flank protection. It'll stay locked in this position until the route which is reached when following the diverging position is clear.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Track Circuits</h3>
    <p>Track circuits detect the existence of a train at the part of a line. Since only one train can be in a single block, they serve a critical purpose.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Gray</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/grayblock.jpg" alt="">
            <p>There is no route set.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Green</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/greenblock.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A route via this track circuit is set.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Red</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/redblock.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The track circuit is occupied.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Purple</h3>
            <img src="../../assets/purpleblock.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A route via this track circuit was set but then cancelled.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
