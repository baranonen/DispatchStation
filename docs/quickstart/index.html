    <h2>Quick Start</h2>
    <p>This page lists the most basic instructions to run the train traffic. For more detailed information, see the other pages as well.</p>
    <h3>Signals</h3>
    <p>Most of the signals are in automatic mode and the dispatcher doesn't need to intervene. However, some of them require the input of the dispatcher because the trains have different destinations. Here's a list of them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>155</h4>
            <p>Trains with the prefix "HL" should be routed to signal 201.</p>
            <p>Trains with the prefix "KR" should be routed to signal 303.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>202</h4>
            <p>All incoming trains should be routed to signal 154.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>304</h4>
            <p>All incoming trains should be routed to signal 154.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>104</h4>
            <p>Trains with the prefix "HY" should be routed to signal 350.</p>
            <p>Trains with the prefix "KY" should be routed to signal 352.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>101</h4>
            <p>All trains should be routed to signal 111.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>103</h4>
            <p>All trains should be routed to signal 111.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When needed, automatic signals can be taken under manual control by following these steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Writing "OMB [signal]" to stop the automatic mode.</li>
        <li>If a green triangle is present (signal is at the start of a queued route), writing "YTI [signal]" to remove the route opening request.</li>
        <li>If the signal is already opened, writing "TYI [signal]" to cancel the opened route.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After this, they can be taken to the automatic mode by following these steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Writing "OSE [signal]" to take the signal to the automatic mode.</li>
        <li>Writing "YTT [signal] [nextsignal]" to create a new route.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that the automatic signals only open routes when a train passes them. This means that the first route after the signal is taken to the automatic mode should be opened manually.</p>
    <h3>Train Numbers</h3>
    <img src="../../assets/trainnumber.png" alt="A train number">
    <p>All of the trains are described with their 2-digit route prefix and 3-digit fixed numbers. This prefix is important because the passenger information system (PIS) lists the trains using these digits.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the prefix needs to be updated when a train reaches the terminal stations. Here's a table that lists the appropriate prefixes:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Old</th>
            <th>New</th>
            <th>New Destination</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HY</td>
            <td>HL</td>
            <td>Havalimanı (Airport)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>KY</td>
            <td>KR</td>
            <td>Kirazlı</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HL</td>
            <td>HY</td>
            <td>Yenikapı (from Havalimanı)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>KR</td>
            <td>KY</td>
            <td>Yenikapı (from Kirazlı)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The prefix "DP" means Depo / <i>Depot</i> and shows that the train is going to the depot in the PIS screens.</p>
    <p>Trains can be renamed using the following commands:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>TND [oldname] [newname]</h4>
            <p>Example: TND HY521 HL521</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>STG [nextsignal] [newname]</h4>
            <p>Example: STG 103 HL521</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Commands</h3>
    <img src="../../assets/terminal.png" alt="The terminal">
    <p>Commands are typed to the terminal, which is placed at the bottom right of the screen. To execute a command, hit Enter.</p>
    <p>Errors from the commands are showed on the left side, with the red color.</p>
